## Project Overview
In IT support, efficiently resolving customer issues is critical for maintaining high satisfaction and minimizing response times. However, with large volumes of incoming tickets, manually categorizing and retrieving similar past cases is inefficient. 

This project uses a hybrid approach that:

- **Clusters Support Tickets** by issue and contectual features
- **Identifies similar past tickets** using text similarity (via MinHashing)
- **Recommends resolutions** based on historical solutions within each cluster


By combing clustering with MinHash-based similarity search, we aim to imporve response accuracy and effciency for incoming support tickets
